# TestMe - Development Plan

## Current Status

TestMe is a specialized test runner designed for **core infrastructure projects** such as those written in C/C++ and those that require compilation before execution. TestMe discovers, compiles, and executes tests with configurable patterns and parallel execution -- ideal for low-level and performance-critical codebases.

Test files can be written in C, C++, shell scripts, Python, Go or Javascript/Typescript.

**Version**: 0.8.22
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22

## Recently Completed

-   ✅ Service health check implementation (2025-10-22)
    -   Implemented active service health checking to replace arbitrary delays
    -   Created HealthCheckManager class with 4 check types: HTTP, TCP, Script, File
    -   HTTP/HTTPS checks verify endpoint status and optional response body
    -   TCP checks verify port is accepting connections
    -   Script checks execute custom commands and verify exit codes
    -   File checks verify existence of ready marker files
    -   Type defaults to 'http' for simplified configuration
    -   Falls back to setupDelay if not configured (backward compatible)
    -   Comprehensive documentation in README, man page, DESIGN.md, CLAUDE.md
    -   Configuration examples in doc/testme.json5
    -   Test coverage: HTTP and TCP health check tests both passing
    -   Benefits: Faster test execution, more reliable service startup
-   ✅ Service shutdown improvements and Ctrl+C handling (2025-10-21)

-   [ ] Integrate with ServiceManager
-   [ ] Update configuration system

**Phase 2** (Advanced):

-   [ ] Implement script-based health checks
-   [ ] Implement file/socket existence checks

**Benefits**:

-   Faster test execution (no unnecessary waiting)
-   More reliable tests (services confirmed ready)
-   Backward compatible (falls back to setupDelay)

## Medium-term Goals (Next Month)

## Long-term Vision

### 1. Package Distribution

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: High

Make TestMe easily installable:

-   [x] npm/bun package publication - Completed (@embedthis/testme)
-   [x] Homebrew formula (macOS) - Completed (installs/homebrew/)
-   [x] winget package (Windows) - Completed (installs/winget/)
-   [x] chocolatey package (Windows) - Completed (installs/chocolatey/)
-   [x] apt packages (Linux) - Completed (installs/apt/)
-   [x] NPM package installation scripts - Completed (bin/install.sh, bin/install.mjs)
-   [x] Automatic binary installation to system paths - Completed
-   [x] Support file installation (testme.h, man page, testme.mod) - Completed
-   [ ] Publish packages to respective registries (npm, homebrew, winget, chocolatey, apt)
-   [ ] yum/rpm packages (RHEL/Fedora)

### 2. Language Extensions

**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: Varies

Support additional languages:

-   [x] Python tests (.tst.py) - Completed
-   [x] Go tests (.tst.go) - Completed
-   [ ] Rust tests (.tst.rs)
-   [ ] Ruby tests (.tst.rb)

### 3. Test Generation Tools

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium

Help users create tests:

-   [x] `tm --init` command to create testme.json5 - Completed
-   [x] `tm --new <name>` to scaffold test files - Completed

## Technical Debt

### High Priority

-   [x] Add unit tests for platform abstraction layer (platform-detector.tst.ts, platform-permissions.tst.ts, platform-process.tst.ts)
-   [x] Document internal APIs (ConfigManager, ServiceManager, ArtifactManager, GlobExpansion)
-   [x] Standardize error handling across handlers (moved combineOutput to base handler, added createErrorResult helper)
-   [x] Add integration tests for service lifecycle (service-lifecycle.tst.ts)
-   [ ] Improve type safety in configuration merging

### Medium Priority

-   [ ] Refactor glob expansion to support nested variables
-   [ ] Optimize path normalization performance
-   [ ] Simplify test handler registration
-   [ ] Improve undefined variable handling consistency
    -   Current behavior is inconsistent:
        -   Special variables: kept as `${VAR}` if undefined
        -   Environment variables: kept as `${VAR}` if undefined
        -   Glob patterns: wrapper removed to `pattern` if no matches
    -   Consider options:
        1. Remove undefined variables entirely (treat as empty string)
        2. Warn about undefined variables (log warning but keep)
        3. Remove `${...}` wrapper uniformly (like glob patterns)
        4. Error on undefined variables (strict mode)
    -   See DESIGN.md "Undefined Variable Behavior" section for details

### Low Priority

-   [ ] Consider migrating to pnpm for package management
-   [ ] Evaluate alternative configuration formats (YAML, TOML)
-   [ ] Explore parallel test compilation
-   [ ] Consider plugin architecture for extensibility

## Ideas Backlog

These are ideas for future consideration:

-   **Watch mode**: Auto-run tests on file changes
-   **Test fixtures**: Shared setup/teardown across test groups
-   **Mocking framework**: Built-in mocking for C tests
-   **Property-based testing**: Fuzzing and property testing support
-   **Benchmark mode**: Performance regression testing
-   **Test sharding**: Split tests across multiple machines
-   **Docker integration**: Containerized test execution
-   **Cloud test runners**: AWS/Azure/GCP integration
