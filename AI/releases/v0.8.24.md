## Bug Fixes

### Configuration Path Resolution with Variables

Fixed a critical issue in configuration inheritance where relative paths containing `${...}` glob expansion variables were not being resolved correctly.

**Problem:**
When a parent configuration contained relative paths with glob expansion variables like:
```json5
environment: {
    BIN: '../build/${PLATFORM}/bin'
}
```

The relative path prefix (`../build/`) was not being resolved to an absolute path before inheritance. This caused child configurations to inherit broken paths relative to the wrong directory.

**Solution:**
Enhanced the path resolution logic in `ConfigManager.resolveRelativePaths()` to:
1. Detect relative paths containing `${...}` variables
2. Split the path into prefix (before first `${`) and suffix (from first `${` onward)
3. Resolve the prefix to an absolute path relative to the config directory
4. Preserve path separator if the prefix ended with one
5. Combine resolved prefix with original suffix containing variables

This ensures that child configurations at any depth can inherit paths with variables that will expand correctly when used.

**Example:**
Parent config at `/project/testme.json5`:
```json5
environment: {
    BIN: '../build/${PLATFORM}/bin'
}
```

Child config at `/project/test/unit/testme.json5` with `inherit: ['environment']`:
- Before: Inherited `../build/${PLATFORM}/bin` (relative to child dir, wrong!)
- After: Inherited `/project/build/${PLATFORM}/bin` (absolute, correct!)

This fix ensures configuration inheritance works correctly for nested test directories that need to reference build artifacts using glob patterns.
