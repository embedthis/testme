# TestMe v0.8.23 Release Notes

Released: October 23, 2025

## Features

- Automatic cleanup of test artifacts after successful tests (failed tests preserve artifacts for debugging)
- `--keep` flag now prevents cleanup of successful test artifacts

## Fixes

- Fixed duplicate cleanup service execution messages
- Fixed empty `.testme` directories remaining after artifact cleanup
- Fixed Windows file locking errors during artifact cleanup
  - Added retry logic with exponential backoff (up to 10 retries, max 2s delay)
  - Cleanup failures now generate warnings instead of marking tests as failed
  - Handles ENOENT (file doesn't exist) gracefully
- Fixed Windows PATH environment variable inheritance in setup scripts
- Fixed service script output capture in non-verbose mode
- Fixed display of both stdout and stderr from failing service scripts
- Fixed relative path display in setup service error messages

## Documentation

- Updated CLI help text and man page for artifact cleanup behavior
- Updated CLAUDE.md with artifact management details
- Improved project documentation

## Notes

This release improves the artifact management workflow by automatically cleaning up build artifacts from passing tests while preserving them for failed tests. This provides a cleaner working directory while maintaining debuggability when tests fail.

The `--keep` flag now has a clear purpose: preserve artifacts from successful tests for inspection or debugging.
