# TestMe v0.8.30 Release Notes

Released: TBD

## Bug Fixes

### Monitor Mode Not Streaming Output in Real-Time

Fixed `--monitor` (`-m`) flag not streaming test output in real-time during test execution. Output now appears progressively as tests run instead of only after completion.

**Root Causes:**

1. **C Tests:** The `testme.h` header functions (`tinfo`, `tdebug`, `tskip`, `twrite`, `tReport`) were not flushing stdout/stderr after printf calls, causing buffered output when stdout was piped to the test runner.

2. **TTY Check:** The `base.ts` handler was enforcing a strict TTY check (`process.stdout.isTTY === true`), preventing streaming when user explicitly requested `--monitor` but output was piped.

**Fixes:**

- Added `fflush(stdout)` and `fflush(stderr)` after all printf/fprintf calls in C test utility functions
- Removed strict TTY requirement - when user explicitly requests `--monitor`, honor it regardless of TTY status
- Added description parameter to `runCommand` calls for better timeout error messages

**Impact:** Long-running tests (like memory leak detection) now show progress in real-time when using `--monitor` flag.

### Go Tests Skipped on Windows

Added platform detection to skip Go tests on Windows. Go tests are now automatically skipped on Windows platforms where the Go toolchain may not be available or compatible.

**Change:** Updated `test/go/skip.js` to detect Windows platform (`process.platform === 'win32'`) and skip tests before checking for Go installation.

**Impact:** Tests no longer fail on Windows CI/CD pipelines due to missing Go support.
